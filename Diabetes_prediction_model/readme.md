# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction model  
**Powered by Logistic Regression | Developed by Kiran**

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on clinical features using a Logistic Regression model trained on the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset**. The app is deployed using **Streamlit** and runs fully in the browser.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧪 Predicts diabetes risk using 8 clinical parameters  
- ⚙️ Logistic Regression model trained on cleaned and preprocessed data  
- 📊 Probability score with visual indicator  
- 🎨 Modern UI with Streamlit  
- 📂 Includes full training notebook (`.ipynb`) for reproducibility  
- 🖼️ App screenshot included for quick preview
